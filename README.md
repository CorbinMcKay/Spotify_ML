# Spotify_ML
Machine Learning project exploring a Spotify music data set.
Through the use of data exploration and data visualization I was able to gain insight and learn about the trends of popular music
and what features have correlation. 

Data cleaning, transformation, reduction and scaling were performed to the dataset before exploring regression models to predict popularity outcomes based on 
corellated data features.
